% Contextualization
Control systems are widely used mainly in industry and seek greater time and energy efficiency while maintaining the quality of processes and the controlled system,
% Gap
however they are still very complex and difficult to implement, requiring a dedicated embedded system.
% Purpose
The porpose of this study is to show an alternative form of closed loop control and implement an unconventional control using Paraconsistent Annotated Logic with annotation of two values (PAL2v)
% Methodology
comparatively to the classical model of control, Proportionl, Integral and Derivative (PID).
% results
Starting from the basics of control, the model with PAL2v has great potential for its implementation and operation of control systems.
% Conclusion
Comparatively, the model is aligned to the classical model, and part of his theory adapted to the care of the PAL2v assumptions.
