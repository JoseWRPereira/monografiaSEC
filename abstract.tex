% Contextualization
Control systems are widely used mainly in the industrial sector and seek greater efficiency of time and energy, maintaining the quality of processes and controlled system,
% Gap
however they are still very complex and difficult to implement, requiring a dedicated embedded system.
% Purpose
The objective of this study is to show an alternative form of closed-loop control and implement an unconventional control using the Annotated Paraconsistent Logic with two-valued annotation (APL2v),
% Methodology
In a comparative manner to the classical Proportional, Integral and Derivative control model (PID).
% Results
Starting from the basic concepts of Paraconsistent Logic,
showing the main forms of use based on
previous works by several authors,
a variation was applied in the use of APL2v
in order to carry out the control in a convenient and adequate way
in accordance with the proposed performance requirements.
% Conclusion
Comparatively, the proposed model aligns itself with the classical model, having part of its theory adapted to the APL2v assumptions.
